[ViziCities](http://vizicities.com) is a 3D city and data visualisation platform, powered by WebGL. Its purpose is to change the way you look at cities and the data contained within them.

**Built something with ViziCities?** [Get in touch](hello@vizicities.com), we'd love to showcase it here for everyone else to see and learn from.


## Changes since 0.1.0-pre

Numerous lessons were learnt after releasing 0.1.0-pre to the public, so much so that the decision was made to start from the beginning and get things right. 0.2.0 is the first attempt at that, a complete rewrite from the ground up. There are some pretty major differences!

### Blueprint API

Data input and visualisation output is now controlled by the [Blueprint API](http://dev.vizicities.com/v0.2.0/docs/using-the-blueprint-api). It's based on the concept of triggers and actions; much like Zapier or IFTTT, just instead for geographic data visualisation. It underpins the entire system for 0.2.0 and it completely changes the way you pull data into ViziCities and how you output it. A lot of hard work went into formulating and constructing it &mdash; we're incredibly proud of it!

In short, the Blueprint API has 3 parts; an input, an output and a mapping configuration. Neither the input nor the output know about each other or care about each others data structure. Everything is neatly brought together by a configuration object that describes which input to use, which output to use, as well as how and, more importantly, when to map the data between them.

It's an incredibly powerful and extensible system and we can't wait to see what you build with it. We're also looking forward to you contributing new inputs and outputs for others to benefit from.

By default, ViziCites now supports:

* Dynamic base maps using standard tile-server URLs (eg. Mapbox)
* GeoJSON input
* Basic KML input (only points so far)
* Collada output
* Choropleth (heatmap-like) output
* Dynamic building output from a vector tile source ([like Mapzen](https://github.com/mapzen/vector-datasource/wiki/Mapzen-Vector-Tile-Service))

Make sure to read the [documentation on the Blueprint API](http://dev.vizicities.com/v0.2.0/docs/using-the-blueprint-api) to learn how to use it.

### Easier setup and customisation

It's now much easier to set up and customise ViziCities. It was clear that 0.1.0-pre was far too prescriptive about how to use the system, so an effort has been made to allow customisation via options or overriding of default functionality. Combined with the Blueprint API, you now have full control over the data and visualisations you want to use.

A result of these changes means that setting up ViziCities is different to how you're used to from 0.1.0-pre. It's worth [reading the documentation](http://dev.vizicities.com) to see how much easier and better things have become.

### Vastly improved controls

The control system has received a lot of love since 0.1.0-pre and, aside from being smoother, it now allow you to use multiple methods of control at once. Right now there are just a few to choose from but this number will grow as new systems are contributed. It's also worth mentioning that the view angle caps in 0.1.0 have been removed &mdash; you can now look wherever you want!


### Other stuff

* More robust and flexible coordinate projection system
* Synchronous update and render loop
* Improved event system
* Simpler file and directory structure
* ViziCities Bower package
* Ready-to-use build of ViziCities in the `build` directory
* Testing across 100% of the core system
* Improved Grunt build process


## Known issues

ViziCities is not complete and there are many things that could be done better or simply need fixing. Here is a list of the major known issues:

* Data isn't cached right now
* There's no post processing (eg. ambient occlusion, etc)
* Lighting cannot be easily customised
* Performance can be improved in areas


## Getting started

Here are some step-by-step instructions on how to get up and running with your first visualisation, a 3D basemap. You can also [use this JSBin](http://jsbin.com/qaqogo/2/edit?html,js,output) to see the example running and play with the code.

The first step is to download the [latest ViziCities build files](https://github.com/vizicities/vizicities/tree/0.2.0/build) (JS & CSS).

Once you've done that then set up the basic HTML and include the ViziCities files:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <meta http-equiv="Content-type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">
  <title>ViziCities - Basic Example</title>

  <style type="text/css">
    html, body {
      height: 100%;
      width: 100%;
    }

    #vizicities-viewport {
      height: 100%;
      width: 100%;
    }
  </style>

  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="vizi.css">
</head>
<body>
  <div id="vizicities-viewport"></div>
  <script src="vizi.min.js"></script>
  <script src="main.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

At this point you can initialise ViziCities in a new script (`main.js` in this example):

```javascript
var world = new VIZI.World({
  viewport: document.querySelector("#vizicities-viewport"),
  center: new VIZI.LatLon(51.50358, -0.01924)
});
```

And add some controls:

```javascript
var controls = new VIZI.ControlsMap(world.camera, {
  viewport: world.options.viewport
});
```

Let's add a basemap using the Blueprint API:

```javascript
var mapConfig = {
  input: {
    type: "BlueprintInputMapTiles",
    options: {
      tilePath: "http://{s}.basemaps.cartocdn.com/light_nolabels/{z}/{x}/{y}@2x.png"
    }
  },
  output: {
    type: "BlueprintOutputImageTiles",
    options: {
      grids: [{
        zoom: 13,
        tilesPerDirection: 5,
        cullZoom: 11
      }]
    }
  },
  triggers: [{
    triggerObject: "output",
    triggerName: "initialised",
    triggerArguments: ["tiles"],
    actionObject: "input",
    actionName: "requestTiles",
    actionArguments: ["tiles"],
    actionOutput: {
      tiles: "tiles" // actionArg: triggerArg
    }
  }, {
    triggerObject: "output",
    triggerName: "gridUpdated",
    triggerArguments: ["tiles"],
    actionObject: "input",
    actionName: "requestTiles",
    actionArguments: ["tiles"],
    actionOutput: {
      tiles: "tiles" // actionArg: triggerArg
    }
  }, {
    triggerObject: "input",
    triggerName: "tileReceived",
    triggerArguments: ["image", "tile"],
    actionObject: "output",
    actionName: "outputImageTile",
    actionArguments: ["image", "tile"],
    actionOutput: {
      image: "image", // actionArg: triggerArg
      tile: "tile"
    }
  }]
};

var switchboardMap = new VIZI.BlueprintSwitchboard(mapConfig);
switchboardMap.addToWorld(world);
```

The last step is to to set up the update and render loop:

```javascript
var clock = new VIZI.Clock();

var update = function() {
  var delta = clock.getDelta();

  world.onTick(delta);
  world.render();

  window.requestAnimationFrame(update);
};

update();
```

## Using ViziCities? Please attribute it

While we love giving you the code to ViziCities for free, we also appreciate getting some recognition for all the hard work that's gone into it. A small, inconspicuous attribution is built into ViziCities and, while possible to remove, we'd really appreciate it if you left it in.

If you really need to remove the attribution, please [get in touch](hello@vizicities.com) and we can work out an alternative.

## Forked ViziCities 0.1.0-pre? Update your remote URL

The ViziCities repo has been moved away from Robin's personal account and now resides within the UDST organisation on GitHub. As a result of this, you'll need to update the remote URL if you've forked ViziCities in the past.

It's pretty easy to do, [GitHub even wrote about how to do it](https://help.github.com/articles/changing-a-remote-s-url/). Running the following command within your ViziCities directory should be enough for most people:

```bash
$ git remote set-url origin git@github.com:UDST/vizicities.git
```

## Getting involved

ViziCities can't happen without your help. We need people to submit bugs, suggest features, share how they're using the project, and contribute code. Sound like you? [Check out exactly how to get involved](https://github.com/vizicities/vizicities/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).
